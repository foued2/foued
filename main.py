# Define a ListNode class that represents elements of a linked list.
class ListNode:
    """"
    It's not always named "ListNode," and you can
    choose any name you prefer. In this code, "ListNode" is used as a common convention for naming such a class,
    but you could name it something else if you find it more meaningful or appropriate for your specific use case.

    The essential components of the ListNode class are:

    val: This attribute stores the value of the node, which is typically an integer but can be adapted for other data
    types as needed.

    next: This attribute is a reference to the next node in the linked list. It's used to construct the linked list
    by connecting nodes.

    In a linked list, each node typically has a next attribute that references the next node in
    the list. When you create a new ListNode without explicitly specifying a next node, it means that by default,
    the next attribute of that node will be set to None.

    For example, if you create a ListNode like this:

    Node1 = ListNode(2)

    In this case, node1 represents a node with a value of 2. However, since you didn't
    specify a next node, its next attribute will be None, indicating that it's the last node in the list (or the only
    node in the case of a single-node list).
